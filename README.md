# GraphQL Server for Elastic Path Commerce Cloud 

[Elastic Path](https://www.elasticpath.com/) is composable, API-first, headless commerce platform.

Contributors welcome ðŸ‘‹

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elasticpath/elasticpath-graphql-server
cd elasticpath-graphql-server
yarn

You will need to set `ELASTICPATH_CLIENT_ID` and `ELASTICPATH_API_HOST` inside `.env` or...

## Development

Start the development server is easy.

Development uses [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) which automatically reloads code after changes.

Visit [http://localhost:4000/playground](http://localhost:4000/playground) where you will be able to perform queries using GraphiQL.

{
  products {
    id
    name
    description
    status
  }

  product(id: "PRODUCT_ID") {
    id
    name
    description
  }

  brands {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
